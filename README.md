🏡 Mumbai House Price Prediction (Decision Tree)

This project applies Machine Learning (Decision Tree Regressor) to predict house prices in Mumbai based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and location.

🔹 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Train a Decision Tree model

Evaluate performance using metrics (MSE, RMSE, R²)

Analyze feature importance

🔹 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔹 Steps Implemented

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Training the Decision Tree Regressor

Model evaluation and feature importance

🔹 Results

The model successfully predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy.

Location and area are the most important factors affecting prices.
